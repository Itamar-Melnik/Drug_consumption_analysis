# Drug Consumption Patterns Analysis

This repository performs exploratory data analysis on drug usage patterns and correlations.

## What's Inside
- `3.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and insights generation.
- `Drug_Consumption.csv`: Original raw dataset from Kaggle.
- `Drug_Consumption_Quantified.csv`: Processed/quantified version of the dataset.

## Project Goal
Analyze drug consumption data to identify patterns, such as peak usage ages, links between light/hard drugs, and absence of alcohol-drug correlations.

## Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (visualization)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Itamar-Melnik/Drug_consumption_analysis.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib`
3. Open and run `3.ipynb` in Jupyter.

## Status
Academic project. No active development; archived for reference.
